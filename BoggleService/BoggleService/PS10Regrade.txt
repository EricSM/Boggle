Fix:
Most of the tests reported internal server errors.  The boggle server interface was implemented wrong.  We didn't know enough about the REST interface
and we relied too much on the Todolist example, which did not use json.

The simple fix was to put ALL the data, whether inputted or outputted to the server, inside wrapper classes.  This changed very little actual core code
like in ps9.

Other minor sources of bugs include: minor sql syntax errors, not checking for dbnulls, not closing readers before commiting database transactions, 
and other miscellaneous typos.

46/61 tests now pass in grader.
