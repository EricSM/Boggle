Fix 1:
a) Most of the tests reported internal server errors.  The boggle server interface was implemented wrong.  We didn't know enough about the REST interface
and we relied too much on the Todolist example, which did not use json.

The simple fix was to put ALL the data, whether inputted or outputted to the server, inside wrapper classes.  This changed very little actual core code.
After implementing simple wrapper classes in DataModel, the only real code that was added from this was to retrieve data in wrapper classes at the beginning 
of the methods CreateUser, JoinGame, and CancelJoin.

The other problem was that in GetGameStatus, we expected the WCF to parse the gameID int from the url.  It can't do that so we changed it so it retrieves 
a string from the url, and then parse it into an int to retrieve the gameID. Again, this changed very little core code; all that was added was to check if
the gameId retrieved from the url can be parsed into an int.

b) Sometimes joingame would return with status "Accepted" instead of "Created". This was caused by checking if player 2 is occupied in pending game.  
This never happens so that code was simply commented out.

c) Forgot to put lock in GetGameStatus where game time is updated.

30 more tests now passed in grader: JoinGame 1-10; MakeUser 1-4; TestCancelGame 1-6; and TestStatus 1-10, 14


Fix 2:
a) Similar to GetGameStatus, we expected the WCF to parse the gameID int from the url.  It can't do that so we changed it so it retrieves 
a string from the url, and then parse it into an int to retrieve the gameID. This changed very little core code; all that was added was to check if
the gameId retrieved from the url can be parsed into an int.

b) Forgot to instantiate dictionaries for player 1 and 2's words and scores.

16 more tests now passed in grader: TestPlayWord 1, 3-8, 11-18

Fix 3:
passed 13 more test
We added load dictionary and also we had some spelling problom
